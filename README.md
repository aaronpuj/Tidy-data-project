# Tidy-data-project
## This repo contains the run_analysis.R script that produces the 'Tidy data.txt' file and a code book that describes the new variables.
## The script works by:
## 1- converting source .txt files to tables
## 2- merging observation tables & extract only mean and std dev measurments (see steps 1 & 2 of course project)
## 3- merging observation table made in step 2 with subject and activity source data & give descriptive name (see steps step 3 & 4 of course project)
## 4- creates an independent tidy data txt file with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (see step 5 of the course project)
